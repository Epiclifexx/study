# Dependencies in the POM

### Dependencies?
Somewhere in your pom file, you will also see a section dedicated to your dependencies and plugins. For example, there is the Spring Boot Starter Web (which is the one we had previously added on the Initializr tool).

You will also find a dependency that comes "free" with the Starter Web. This is the Spring Boot Starter Test. You see, Maven always performs tests before running your applications. All the logs screen that you saw previously when you ran the application and the Spring logo appeared, if you read those logs, you will realize that Maven itself was already testing your application before it was executed.

Of course, in addition to the dependencies, you will also see the Plugins section, which comes with one included. It is a Maven plugin for Spring Boot. This plugin only allows us to perform certain actions that are necessary to generate the executable JAR file (this would be for when we execute the "maven package" command).
