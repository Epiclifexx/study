# mvnw File

### What's this "mvnw" file?
In addition to the files already mentioned, you will also find some others that belong to Maven. For example, the files "mvnw" and "mvnw.cmd".

### What are they for?
Don't worry, they're just commands.

### What are they there for then?
As far as I know, they are there to be run in case you don't have Maven installed. As far as I know, they may also be responsible for downloading some packages.
