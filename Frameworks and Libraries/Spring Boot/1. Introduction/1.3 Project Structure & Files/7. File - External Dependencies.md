# External Dependencies

### Analyzing External Dependencies (external libraries)
Now, one last thing to see here would be the list of "External Libraries". This list is the list of external dependencies that we got by simply creating a Spring Boot application. Within it you will see that we have many dependencies related to different areas.

For example, we have some frameworks for log management and sampling, such as Log4J and Logback. Some have to do with documentation, like JSON by Jackson Core, there is also Jsonpath that came from testing, and speaking of testing, there is also JUnit 5. A testing framework in Java.

There is also Jakarta info for J2EE, plus TomCat related dependencies. It is an embedded and configured server that we already have and use.
