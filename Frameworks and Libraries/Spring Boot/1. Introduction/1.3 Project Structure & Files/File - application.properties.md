# What is the application.properties file for?
Well, if we now go and open the "resources" folder, you will see that there are three other files inside. We have empty "static" and "template" folders and an empty file called "application.properties".

This curious file is used to store our "properties files".

### What are they for?
Well, we are going to use them in the future to control the configuration of the Application Context.
