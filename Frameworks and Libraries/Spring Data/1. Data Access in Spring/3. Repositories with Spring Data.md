# Repositories with Spring Data
So now, we will be implementing our first Spring Data repository and using our embedded database as a data store.

So, using the project we already have in this folder (and already made the configuration for the embedded database), we're going to open up the schema file. The reason for this, is that we're going to need some info from it, so let's keep it open for now.
## Creating an Entity 
Now, let's create a new package called "**data**" inside src>main>java>whatever package is here.

Inside that "**data**" package, we're gonna create a Java class called "**Room**". Ok, so here, what we really doing is to represent a table from our embedded database, in this case, the table "**ROOM**".

So, now that we have our "Room" class created, the first thing we're gonna do is to annotate it with "**@Entity**" from javax persistence.

Then we're going to annotate it with "**@Tablet**", and as we're doing that, we're going to specify the **name of the table** just like it is in the schema. So we should write something like this: `@Table(name="ROOM")`.

Now, if you take reference from the Schema we have opened, you'll see that the table "ROOM" has 4 values in it. Which, I assume these represent columns. Well, you could copy/paste them inside our "Room" class as comments maybe, the idea of this, is to get a reference so we can currently map our class to this table. You see, the idea now is to represent these values with variables or "Properties" inside our class.

Now, there's some concepts here and there while we map this class that maybe we would understand a little more if we also study SQL. Concepts like "Primary Key", or the "Generation Type", etc.

So, in order to represent these values:
```sql
CREATE TABLE ROOM(  
  ROOM_ID BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,  
  NAME VARCHAR(16) NOT NULL,  
  ROOM_NUMBER CHAR(2) NOT NULL UNIQUE,  
  BED_INFO CHAR(2) NOT NULL  
);
```
In our Entity Java Class, our class should look like this:
```java
@Entity  
@Table(name="ROOM")  
public class Room {  
    @Id  
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)  
    @Column(name="ROOM_ID")  
    private long id;  
  
    @Column(name="NAME")  
    private String name;  
  
    @Column(name="ROOM_NUMBER")  
    private String roomNumber;  
  
    @Column(name="BED_INFO")  
    private String bedInfo;  
}
```

Oh, and don't forget to do the getters & setters (of course, if you use Lombok, I assume you don't need to). Also, we're going to override the "toString" method. So now, our Entity Class should look like this:

```java
@Entity  
@Table(name="ROOM")  
public class Room {  
    @Id  
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)  
    @Column(name="ROOM_ID")  
    private long id;  
  
    @Column(name="NAME")  
    private String name;  
  
    @Column(name="ROOM_NUMBER")  
    private String roomNumber;  
  
    @Column(name="BED_INFO")  
    private String bedInfo;  
  
    public long getId() {  
        return id;  
    }  
    public void setId(long id) {  
        this.id = id;  
    }  
    public String getName() {  
        return name;  
    }  
    public void setName(String name) {  
        this.name = name;  
    }  
    public String getRoomNumber() {  
        return roomNumber;  
    }  
    public void setRoomNumber(String roomNumber) {  
        this.roomNumber = roomNumber;  
    }  
    public String getBedInfo() {  
        return bedInfo;  
    }  
    public void setBedInfo(String bedInfo) {  
        this.bedInfo = bedInfo;  
    }  
    @Override  
    public String toString() {  
        return "Room{" +  
                "id=" + id +  
                ", name='" + name + '\'' +  
                ", roomNumber='" + roomNumber + '\'' +  
                ", bedInfo='" + bedInfo + '\'' +  
                '}';  
    }}
```

Ok, so now that our Entity class is done, it's time to create something else in order to implement the good ol' classic CRUD methods. Oh, and don't worry, you don't really have to create them, actually, in Spring Data, you just have to create an Interface. Yup, let me show you.
## Creating the Repository (CRUD Operations)
Now, (in the same package) we create an Interface called "RoomRepository". And once it's created, we're gonna extend from "CrudRepository" Interface.

In order to use the CRUD operations, we shall specify the Entity we're using, and the class type of the id. Also, we're going to annotate this class with "@Repository". So, our "RoomRepository" should look like this:
```java
import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;  
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;  
  
@Repository  
public interface RoomRepository extends CrudRepository<Room,Long> {  
  
}
```
## Visualizing our data access working
Now, I'm just following the LinkedIn course, and I think that this part is ONLY to visualize how the data access is working, so, I mean, is not something I would usually do at work.

But I guess is worth to see how it works.

So, now in order to see how the data access is working, we're going to create a new package called "**util**" inside src>main>java>whatever package is here. And then, inside of it, we're going to create a java class called "**AppStartupEvent**".

So, once created, we're going to annotate it with "**@Component**" annotation, so that Spring will pick it up. This class is going to implement our "**ApplicationListener**" and specifically, we're going to look for the "**ApplicationReadyEvent**".

Now, the reason we're doing all this, is so that we can wait until Spring is actually done building and ready to do work before we go and query the database, because it's very important, that the database is all set up by the time we run this code.

Now,... I don't really know what an "Application Listener" even is,.. I mean, I suppose by its name, maybe it has something to do with logs about the work or operations certain class does. Not really sure.

So, now, our new class should look like this:
```java
import org.springframework.boot.context.event.ApplicationReadyEvent;  
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationListener;  
  
public class AppStartupEvent implements ApplicationListener<ApplicationReadyEvent> {  
    @Override  
    public void onApplicationEvent(ApplicationReadyEvent event){  
  
    }
}
```

Now, I think this "**onApplicationEvent**" method, is just an abstract method to be implemented.

So now, we're going to add some values. The first, is to add a private final RoomRepository property to the class, and to initialize it, we're going to need a constructor, so, it should look like this:
```java
import com.frankmoley.lil.learningspring.data.RoomRepository;  
import org.springframework.boot.context.event.ApplicationReadyEvent;  
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationListener;  
  
public class AppStartupEvent implements ApplicationListener<ApplicationReadyEvent> {  
    private final RoomRepository roomRepository;
    
    public AppStartupEvent(RoomRepository roomRepository) {  
        this.roomRepository = roomRepository;  
    }
    
    @Override  
    public void onApplicationEvent(ApplicationReadyEvent event){
    }
}
```

Now, inside the Override method, we're going to create something called an "**Iterable**" and its going to be an Iterable of Rooms. Now, the way this works (apparently) is that now, without any coding at all, you can see that we have all the CRUD methods already created. So we can use "findAll()" for example, or "findById", so that's the useful part of Spring Data I assume. Although, I'm pretty sure there's a lot more.

So now, we get all the rooms in the "rooms" variable using the find All method. And then, we can call the "for each" method using the variable "rooms". And for each iteration, we can call a method, like for example: `System.out::println`. So, our code should look like this now:
```java
import com.frankmoley.lil.learningspring.data.Room;  
import com.frankmoley.lil.learningspring.data.RoomRepository;  
import org.springframework.boot.context.event.ApplicationReadyEvent;  
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationListener;  
  
public class AppStartupEvent implements ApplicationListener<ApplicationReadyEvent> {  
  
    private final RoomRepository roomRepository;  
  
    public AppStartupEvent(RoomRepository roomRepository) {  
        this.roomRepository = roomRepository;  
    }  
    @Override  
    public void onApplicationEvent(ApplicationReadyEvent event){  
        // First, we get all the rooms in the "rooms" variable.  
        Iterable<Room> rooms= this.roomRepository.findAll();  
  
        // Now we're going to iterate it. And for every item of rooms, we're going to call the println method.  
        rooms.forEach(System.out::println);  
    }}
```

So now if I run this application, I can see the logs in the console.

And what you see is (according to the teacher) after the application started, we now have standard output being written that is listing each of our Rooms based on our "**to String**" method that came from the database.
