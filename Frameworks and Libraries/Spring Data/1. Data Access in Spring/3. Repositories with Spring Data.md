# Repositories with Spring Data
So now, we will be implementing our first Spring Data repository and using our embedded database as a data store.

So, using the project we already have in this folder (and already made the configuration for the embedded database), we're going to open up the schema file. The reason for this, is that we're going to need some info from it, so let's keep it open for now.
## Creating an Entity 
Now, let's create a new package called "**data**" inside src>main>java>whatever package is here.

Inside that "**data**" package, we're gonna create a Java class called "**Room**". Ok, so here, what we really doing is to represent a table from our embedded database, in this case, the table "**ROOM**".

So, now that we have our "Room" class created, the first thing we're gonna do is to annotate it with "**@Entity**" from javax persistence.

Then we're going to annotate it with "**@Tablet**", and as we're doing that, we're going to specify the **name of the table** just like it is in the schema. So we should write something like this: `@Table(name="ROOM")`.

Now, if you take reference from the Schema we have opened, you'll see that the table "ROOM" has 4 values in it. Which, I assume these represent columns. Well, you could copy/paste them inside our "Room" class as comments maybe, the idea of this, is to get a reference so we can currently map our class to this table. You see, the idea now is to represent these values with variables or "Properties" inside our class.

Now, there's some concepts here and there while we map this class that maybe we would understand a little more if we also study SQL. Concepts like "Primary Key", or the "Generation Type", etc.

So, in order to represent these values:
```sql
CREATE TABLE ROOM(  
  ROOM_ID BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,  
  NAME VARCHAR(16) NOT NULL,  
  ROOM_NUMBER CHAR(2) NOT NULL UNIQUE,  
  BED_INFO CHAR(2) NOT NULL  
);
```
In our Entity Java Class, then out Entity Class should look like this:
```java
@Entity  
@Table(name="ROOM")  
public class Room {  
    @Id  
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)  
    @Column(name="ROOM_ID")  
    private long id;  
  
    @Column(name="NAME")  
    private String name;  
  
    @Column(name="ROOM_NUMBER")  
    private String roomNumber;  
  
    @Column(name="BED_INFO")  
    private String bedInfo;  
}
```

Oh, and don't forget to do the getters & setters (of course, if you use Lombok, I assume you don't need to). Also, we're going to override the "toString" method. So now, our Entity Class should look like this:

```java
@Entity  
@Table(name="ROOM")  
public class Room {  
    @Id  
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)  
    @Column(name="ROOM_ID")  
    private long id;  
  
    @Column(name="NAME")  
    private String name;  
  
    @Column(name="ROOM_NUMBER")  
    private String roomNumber;  
  
    @Column(name="BED_INFO")  
    private String bedInfo;  
  
    public long getId() {  
        return id;  
    }  
    public void setId(long id) {  
        this.id = id;  
    }  
    public String getName() {  
        return name;  
    }  
    public void setName(String name) {  
        this.name = name;  
    }  
    public String getRoomNumber() {  
        return roomNumber;  
    }  
    public void setRoomNumber(String roomNumber) {  
        this.roomNumber = roomNumber;  
    }  
    public String getBedInfo() {  
        return bedInfo;  
    }  
    public void setBedInfo(String bedInfo) {  
        this.bedInfo = bedInfo;  
    }  
    @Override  
    public String toString() {  
        return "Room{" +  
                "id=" + id +  
                ", name='" + name + '\'' +  
                ", roomNumber='" + roomNumber + '\'' +  
                ", bedInfo='" + bedInfo + '\'' +  
                '}';  
    }}
```

Ok, so now that our Entity class is done,
