# Java List Node

### What is List Node?
In Java, the ListNode is a crucial data structure used to implement linked lists efficiently.

Linked lists are dynamic data structures that consist of nodes, where each node holds a value and a reference to the next node in the list.

A ListNode represents a single node in a linked list. It typically contains two main components: the value or data stored in the node and a reference (or link) to the next node in the list. By connecting these nodes, we can create a flexible and efficient data structure capable of handling various operations.
