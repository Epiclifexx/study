# What's a "Lambda Expression or Function"?
First of all, to understand what lambdas are and how they work, maybe I should first understand some basic concepts before diving in.

### Lambdas are meant to be used with Interfaces
From what I'm researching, a lambda function or expressi√≥n is like some sort of anonymous function.

These name-less functions are usually used to implement certain methods from certain Interfaces.

Now, of course I could just go now, and try to do some code with lambdas, but, another thing that could be helpful is to get to know first what "Functional Programming" is.

Because, yo see, one of the purposes or maybe the solo purpose (I don't know yet) of using lambdas is to be able to code using some kind of functional programming approach.

And lambdas are usually used with interfaces like "Predicate", "BiFunction", or objects like Streams and stuff. All these things were implemented in Java 8, like some sort of functional programming approach in Java.

So maybe just learning the basics of what Functional Programming is, learning concepts like "First-Class Citizens" and "Concurrency" could be a good idea.
