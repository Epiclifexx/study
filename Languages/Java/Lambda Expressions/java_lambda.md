# What's a "Lambda Expression or Function"?
First of all, to understand what lambdas are and how they work, maybe I should first understand some basic concepts before diving in.

### Lambdas are meant to be used with Interfaces
From what I'm researching, a lambda function or expressión is like some sort of anonymous function.

These name-less functions are usually used to implement certain methods from certain Interfaces.

Now, of course I could just go now, and try to do some code with lambdas, but, another thing that could be helpful is to get to know first what "Functional Programming" is.

Because, yo see, one of the purposes or maybe the solo purpose (I don't know yet) of using lambdas is to be able to code using some kind of functional programming approach. Or maybe you just need a single implementation to be done.

In any case...

Lambdas are usually used with interfaces like "Predicate", "BiFunction", or objects like Streams and stuff. All these things were implemented in Java 8, like some sort of functional programming approach in Java.

So maybe just learning the basics of what Functional Programming is, learning concepts like "First-Class Citizens" and "Concurrency" could be a good idea.

### Order of java files in the examples
In this folder, there's two sub-folders. One does not implement lambda functions. It help us to compare. The order of reading is:
1. NON-LAMBDA APPROACH:
    1. Printable (Interface)
    2. Cat (Class)
    3. Main (Main class with the Main method)
2. LAMBDA APPROACH:
    1. Printable (Interface)
    2. Main (Main class with the Main method)
