# Working with Streams
### Intermediate & Terminal Operations

#### What are Intermediate & Terminal Operations?
After we have created a Stream, we can work with it in multiple ways. First of all, you have to know that there's two kind of operations when we're working with a Stream.

**Intermediate Operations & Terminal Operations**

**Intermediate Operations**: Intermediate Operations can be chained and return a new version of the Stream.

They are also lazy. It means that they don't execute until a Terminal Operation is called.

*Common Intermediate Operations*:
1. **Filter**: This Filter element is based on a Predicate.
2. **Map**: Transform elements using a given function (and a function is a type of build-in functional interface here).
3. **flatMap**: This transforms each element into a Stream and then flattens the resulting Streams into a single Stream.

There are quite a few more, but these are the most used.

**Terminal Operations**: When you perform a Terminal Operation, the Stream ends and no other operation can be performed on it anymore.

*Common Terminal Operations*:
1. **forEach**: This is going to apply an action to each element in the Stream, literally "for each".
2. **collect**: This one is going to get all the elements of the Stream and collect them into a collection such as a list or a set.
3. **reduce**: This reduces the Stream to a single value using an acumulator function.
