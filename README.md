# Study

### What's this?
Just a personal Github repo for code and notes for studying purposes. This is by no means, a guide for any language, tool or framework.

### Note
Also, I'm not a native english speaker, so this is also some kind of english writing practice for me. Feel free to correct me if you see anything it could be done better or just in other way.
