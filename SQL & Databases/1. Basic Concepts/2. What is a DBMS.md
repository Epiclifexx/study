# 2. What is a DBMS
So, we already know the general definition of what a Database is. Now, when we talk about relational digital databases, like the one an application could use to store data about users and stuff, that kind of database is created and managed by a thing we call a "**DBMS**", which is short for "**Database Management System**".

Now, of course there's many DBMS out there, and different ways to storage data, but first, let's properly answer the question "**What is a DBMS**"?

Well, a DBMS is a special software program that helps users create and maintain a database on a computer.
* Makes it easy to manage large amounts of information.
* Handles security.
* Backups
* Importing/ Exporting data.
* Concurrency.
* Interacts with software applications 

So, one thing one should understand is that the DBMS is not the Database itself. The Database is the data to save and manage, but the one in charge of managing that database is the DBMS itself.
