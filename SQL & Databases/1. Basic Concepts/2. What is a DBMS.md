# 2. What is a DBMS
So, we already know the general definition of what a Database is. Now, when we talk about relational digital databases, like the one an application could use to store data about users and stuff, that kind of database is created and managed by a thing we call a "**DBMS**", which is short for "**Database Management System**".

Now, of course there's many DBMS out there, and different ways to storage data.
